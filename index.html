          <div class="content">
            <p>When veteran Chinese journalist Gao Yu, 71, was imprisoned in April 2014 she was already in bad health. The longer she remained in prison, the worse her condition became.</p>
            <p>Gao suffers from heart disease, high blood pressure, Meniere’s disease – a disorder of the inner ear that causes severe dizziness, ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and a feeling of congestion in the ear , a chronic skin allergy, tendon inflammation, and a swollen lymph node that may or may not be cancerous.</p>
            <blockquote> “I don’t want to die here,” Gao told her lawyer, Shang Baoyun, in July.</blockquote>
            <p>She had been detained in Beijing No. 1 Detention Center since April 2014, and was not receiving the healthcare she needed, Shang said in an email to Capital News Service.</p>
            <iframe width="100%" height="450" frameborder="0" src="https://mdeason89.cartodb.com/viz/75b6008a-a517-11e5-a9bb-0e3ff518bd15/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Gao is not the only prisoner whose health deteriorated behind bars. There are currently 15 people on Chinese Human Rights Defenders’ watch list of prisoners of conscience in need of medical attention. Four others have died since 2006 as a result of being denied medical care while in custody, the group alleges.</p>
            <p>One of them was Cao Shunli, a legal rights activist. Cao had a liver condition that she managed with medication when she was detained in September 2013. Authorities did not allow her to take her medication and she died in March 2014.</p>
            <p>Withholding medical treatment to prisoners is not only against Chinese law, but also a form of torture, according to human rights organizations.</p>
            <p>“Withholding medical treatment for activists in detention and prison in order to weaken or punish them is a tried and tested tactic,”  said Roseann Rife, East Asia Research Director at Amnesty International, in a statement.</p>
            <p>Hu Jianlong, a journalist for Southern Weekly, said in an interview, “I don’t think the Chinese government wants them to die there.” They are using the threat of death and the strain of poor health to pressure prisoners to confess or to refrain from writing about controversial topics in the future, Hu said.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>Gao was arrested on April 24, 2014 at her house. Chinese authorities accused her of leaking “state secrets.” According to the indictment, she is suspected of having sent Document No. 9, also known as “seven things we don’t speak about,” to Ho Pin, who runs Mingjing News, a New York based Chinese politics newspaper, via Skype around June/July 2013.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In a New York Times Op-Ed, Ho denied these claims and said that he received the document from “a man who identified himself as an official for the Chinese Communist Party’s Propaganda Department in Beijing.” He wrote testimony of this for Gao Yu’s lawyer to use in her case.</p>
            <p>Document No. 9 is a Chinese government document that criticizes “western values” such as democracy, human rights, and freedom of the press.</p>
            <p>Teng Biao, a Chinese human rights lawyer and fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said in a phone interview that, “It’s really ridiculous to charge her with this crime,” because the document simply lists the communist party’s priorities and the content cannot be considered state secrets. “She didn’t commit any crime.”</p>
            <p>Millions of Chinese officials received this file directly from the government, and it was spread widely on China’s Internet in May 2013, Su Yutong, a friend and former colleague of Gao, said in an email. “Even I wrote an article about it in May 2013” before Gao was accused of publishing it.</p>
            <blockquote>The reason Gao was arrested, Su said, is because she criticized communism and President Xi Jinping in the media.</blockquote>
            <p>After Xi took office, Gao wrote many articles for the German government’s Deutsche Welle that detailed the suppression of press freedom and the power struggle between dissidents and the Communist Party.</p>
            <p>There is a video from Gao Yu’s visit to New York in which she strongly criticizes Xi Jinping’s policy and calls it a dictatorship, Teng said. “So Xi Jinping and the top leaders are very angry at her.”</p>
            <p>Gao’s special ability to write about these dangerous topics was widely recognized by her peers.</p>
            <p>“Her analysis on Chinese politics is so deep,” said Teng “…she has some friends who are working for the central government, so we feel that she always has some important information on China’s top leaders.”</p>

            <p>China does not have an independent media and is one of the most restrictive places for journalists in the world.  Reporters Without Borders ranked China 176 out of 180 countries in its 2015 worldwide index of press freedom.</p>
            <p>Many of the largest media outlets are state controlled and there is heavy pressure not to publish information that is critical of the government or its officials. State media is often used to promote the government’s values and beliefs, and Internet censorship limits access to foreign news sources.</p>
            <p>Google, Facebook, and Twitter are all blocked in China. In place of these, there are the state run Baidu, Renren, and Weibo. All internet servers are in Beijing, and the government can access the data at any time. </p>
            <blockquote>According to the Committee to Protect Journalist’s 2014 prison census, China has the most imprisoned journalists in the world at 44. </blockquote>

            <p>Pressure on the media has only continued to intensify.</p>
            <p>Gao was arrested near the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, a popular time for the Chinese government to crackdown on dissidents.</p>
            <p>About 20 lawyers and citizen dissidents were rounded up this past July and charged with various crimes. Nearly 300 people including Shang, Gao’s lawyer, were questioned, Shang said.</p>
            <p>Another large crackdown occurred in 2011, when more than 54 activists and lawyers were arrested.  The crackdown was in response to the 2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests, known as the Jasmine Revolution, that started online and spanned over two dozen cities.  It followed the revolutions throughout the Middle East.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>Many political prisoners are forced to make public confessions of anti-state activities on state television.</p>
            <p>Gao also gave a televised confession, which was used against her in her trial. “Chinese authorities used her son's personal safety to threaten her and force her to confess,” said Su. Her son was also in police custody at the time. After her confession he was released.</p>
            <p>She was found guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison. She was imprisoned twice before, first in 1989 after the Tiananmen protests, then in 1993 for allegedly releasing state secrets.  In both cases she was eventually released because of her poor health.</p>
            <p>While in custody the third time, Gao’s health condition worsened.</p>
            <p>“In July 2014, she was taken by Beijing police to Beijing Anzhen Hospital Cardiovascular Unit, where she was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, and it was also found that she has abnormal lymph node swelling,” Su said.</p>
            <p>The prison gave her traditional Chinese medicine instead of the proper medications, the CHRD reported. They also denied her a visit to a specialized hospital for treatment, Su said.</p>
            <p>In July, 2014, Gao met with her lawyer and told him she feared she would die in prison. Cao Shunlin had died just a few months before.</p>
            <p>Another imprisoned journalist, Yang Tongyan, has been denied proper treatment under the justification made by Nanjing Prison authorities that “his chronic illnesses can be treated in prison,” according to Shreya Balhara, the Free Expression Programs Coordinator at PEN American Center, a non-profit advocacy organization.</p>
            <p>Yang suffers from many illnesses, including intestinal tuberculosis, tuberculosis of the  abdomen lining, diabetes, kidney inflammation, high blood pressure and arthritis," said Balhara.</p>
            <p>Every week, Gao Yu “undergoes intense interrogation by Beijing secret police,” said Su. They want to force her to confess and to change lawyers. “When she refuses to confess, the police punish her, including refusing to provide effective medical treatments and forcing her to sit on a hard bench as corporal punishment.” They have also ignored her requests to meet with her lawyer.</p>
            <p>Her lawyer, Shang, said that China’s prisons are one of the worst in the world.</p>
            <blockquote>“Crowded cells – usually less than 1 square meter per person – bad food, forced labor and physical abuse are very common.”</blockquote>
            <p>There are often stories in the paper of prisoners who have died mysterious deaths, he said.</p>
            <p>Duan Huimin was detained and beaten by police in 2006. He was released, unconscious, after 57 days and died two days later, CHRD reported.</p>
            <p>The next year, activist Chen Xiaoming was detained, tortured, and denied medicine. He also died two days after his release, according to CHRD.</p>
            <p>In March 2014, Tibetan Gushal Lobsang died after being mistreated in prison. He had been serving a 12-year sentence before he was released on medical parole. He died at home months later, according to Radio Free Asia and CHRD.</p>

            <p>Gao’s most recent heart attack was on Oct. 3. Although she recovered after infusion therapy, concern about her condition grew, according to Shang.</p>
            <p>In October he said he had applied for her release for urgent medical treatment. Many foreign governments and international human rights organizations also urged her release, he said.</p>
            <p>At the time Shang was still optimistic.</p>
            <blockquote>“I think she still has chance to be released early, even though it's difficult to be acquitted!” he said in an email.</blockquote>
            <p>Shang was right.</p>
            <p>On November 26, 2015, Gao’s sentence was reduced to five years and she was released on medical parole. She will serve the remainder of her five-year sentence under house arrest.</p>
